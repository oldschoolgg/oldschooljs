Below you will find some of the most talked about content updates over the last few months and we want to ask you tell us what your top three are. We will poll three identical questions. At the end of the poll we will combine the results to identify the updates which are most important to you. Having the same question three times will allow you to vote for more than one update if you are excited by more than one of these options. Of course, if you are only interested in one update then you can vote for it in all the questions. Although the results of this poll will identify to us what is important to you, it won't necessarily be possible for us to release these updates in the order of importance and therefore poll these ideas in that order. Some of the updates listed below will require new skills to be brought into the team, new technology or new game engine features. Knowing what is important to you will allow us to start work on acquiring the new skills, technology and anything else to be able to deliver these updates, even if the updates are months in the future.",

		"description": "Back in March we ran a poll to ask you what you think our priorities should be for Old School. As we have delivered a large majority of the content that you voted as a priority we think it is time to hold another one. In the last priority poll, many of you voted for some kind of trading update. Since then, the trading post has been polled, and it will be delivered once the engine team gets a chance to create their side of it. While we're waiting for that, we'd like to address some of the other game update requests you've sent us. Below you will find some of the most talked about content updates over the last few months and we want to ask you tell us what your top three are. We will poll three identical questions. At the end of the poll we will combine the results to identify the updates which are most important to you. Having the same question three times will allow you to vote for more than one update if you are excited by more than one of these options. Of course, if you are only interested in one update then you can vote for it in all the questions.",

If you haven't watched the livestream yet, please make sure you do as this is probably the most important update Old School has ever had. You can find the full stream on www.youtube.com/OldSchoolRSCommunity. Membership Bonds are very similar to RS3 bonds with the main difference being that you will not be able to redeem them for anything other than membership. We will also not be introducing Runecoins, Squeal of Fortune, Treasure Hunter, Solomon's Store or any other sort of micro-transactions - we wouldn't add these without their own poll and there's no plans for that at all. During the livestream on Sunday we spoke about why we believed introducing a full and permanent F2P service with Membership Bonds is the right thing to do. Introducing Membership Bonds allows us to retain players who lapse out of membership when they have the option of playing a free version of the game. The result is that we will be in the best position to grow the community over the next few years giving us the opportunity to expand the team and deliver bigger and better updates so you can enjoy Old School even more.",
